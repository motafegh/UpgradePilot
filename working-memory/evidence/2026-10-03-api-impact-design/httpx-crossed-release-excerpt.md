## 0.28.1 (6th December, 2024)

* Fix SSL case where `verify=False` together with client side certificates.
 
## 0.28.0 (28th November, 2024)

The 0.28 release includes a limited set of deprecations.

**Deprecations**:

We are working towards a simplified SSL configuration API.

*For users of the standard `verify=True` or `verify=False` cases, or `verify=<ssl_context>` case this should require no changes. The following cases have been deprecated...*

* The `verify` argument as a string argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.
* The `cert` argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.

Our revised [SSL documentation](docs/advanced/ssl.md) covers how to implement the same behaviour with a more constrained API.

**The following changes are also included**:

* The deprecated `proxies` argument has now been removed.
* The deprecated `app` argument has now been removed.
* JSON request bodies use a compact representation. (#3363)
* Review URL percent escape sets, based on WHATWG spec. (#3371, #3373)
* Ensure `certifi` and `httpcore` are only imported if required. (#3377)
* Treat `socks5h` as a valid proxy scheme. (#3178)
* Cleanup `Request()` method signature in line with `client.request()` and `httpx.request()`. (#3378)
* Bugfix: When passing `params={}`, always strictly update rather than merge with an existing querystring. (#3364)
